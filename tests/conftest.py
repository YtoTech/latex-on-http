    # Pros:
    # * sure we're testing target integration env;
    # * no need to install Latex on the host machine to run tests;
    # * we can wait for the command to finish before starting the tests.

    # It is launched externally, so we can still run tests
    # on the host or any configuration.

    # To let Docker takes care of itself, simply use:
    # make test-docker-compose

    # TODO Make the port configurable.
    # Use an env variable.
